* prio_level:
* -------------------
* priorityLevel: Allows you to set a custom priority level for the fee. If priorityLevel is not specified, 
* the API will use the Medium (50th percentile) level. The levels and their corresponding percentiles are:
*     Min: 0th percentile
*     Low: 25th percentile
*     Medium: 50th percentile
*     High: 75th percentile
*     VeryHigh: 95th percentile
*     UnsafeMax: 100th percentile (use with caution).

* Sorted from high risk to lower risk - however all of them are still risky!
* 1. Freeze Authority Still Enabled: 
* This means that the developers or issuer of the coin have the ability to freeze transactions or revert them. 
* This can be a sign of a lack of decentralization and can undermine your confidence in the stability 
* and security of the coin.
* 2. Single Holder Ownership: 
* If a single wallet holder owns a large portion of the coins, this person could manipulate the market by 
* selling off or withholding large amounts. This is risky for you as the value of your investment could 
* heavily depend on the actions of one person.
* 3. High Holder Concentration: 
* Similar to single holder ownership, but here, a few holders own a large percentage of the coins. This increases 
* the risk of market manipulations and price fluctuations if these major holders suddenly decide to sell.
* 4. Large Amount of LP Unlocked: 
* LP stands for Liquidity Provider. If a large amount of the liquidity pool tokens are unlocked, 
* providers could withdraw them at any time, which could lead to a sudden loss of liquidity and a potential price drop.
* 5. Low Liquidity:
* Low liquidity means there are not many coins available for buying or selling. This can lead to extreme 
* price changes even with small buy or sell orders. It's risky because you might not be able to sell your 
* coins without significantly impacting the price.
* 6. Copycat Token: 
* A token that is simply a copy of another existing token, often without any innovative features or improvements. 
* This can indicate a lack of seriousness or potential for long-term growth.
* 7. Low Amount of LP Providers: 
* Having few liquidity providers means the liquidity of the token depends on a few sources. 
* This can be risky, as if these providers decide to withdraw their funds, it could destabilize the market.
